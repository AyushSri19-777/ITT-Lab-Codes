<p> Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play,
except for the goalkeepers within the penalty area. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, 
but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. 
If the score is level at the end of the game, either a draw is declared or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shootout depending on the format of the competition. </p>
